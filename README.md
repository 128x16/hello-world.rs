ðŸš€ hello-world.rs ðŸš€
--------------



ðŸš€ Memory safe, blazing fast, minimal and configurable hello world project written in the rust programming language  ðŸš€

ðŸš€ While this depends on more c code than rust code to compile, because rust is magically memory safe, now all c code is memory safe too ðŸš€

ðŸš€ This project is very minimal, it only requires 724 crates ðŸš€


### Why rust while its only 1 line and depends on 600 c bind creates?ðŸš€
> People ask the question "what's Rust good for?" pretty frequently, and little terminal apps like this are precisely the reason. [...]. It enables a kind of workflow that simply didn't exist before: I could have a fully safe, "correct", LLVM-optimized binary installed on my desktop in an afternoon.ðŸš€

> Modern Rust appears pretty similar to modern JavaScript. You declare your variables with letðŸš€

> I think it would make Rust more productive if Rust could absorb Python's ecosystem(many mature wheels) as soon as possible.ðŸš€

> One thing I like about Rust is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another Rust programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.ðŸš€

> The thing I hate about Rust the most is that all the other languages feel extra dumb and annoying once I learned borrowing, lifetimes etc.ðŸš€

> "I feel like the discovery of Rust is transporting me back to my younger self [...]" "When I started learning Rust in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself."ðŸš€

> Rustâ€™s product is not a programming language or a compiler. Rustâ€™s product is the experience of being a Rust developerðŸš€

> Rust can handle CPU-intensive operations such as executing algorithms. ðŸš€

> Because itâ€™s typically typed, Rust catches errors at compile time. [...] Also, it compiles code down to machine learning, allowing for extra efficiency.ðŸš€

> Many people try to compare Rust to Go, but this is flawed. Go is an ancient board game that emphasizes strategy. Rust is more appropriately compared to Chess, a board game focused on low-level tactics.ðŸš€

> Rust's unsafe keyword is a critical innovation for information security. I believe that Safe Rust will eventually be a foundational technology for all of human society.ðŸš€

> I am too dumb to write c code, even if I spend more time on rust writing bad code its rust, so its betterðŸš€

> Without really understanding anything about rust, its cool to hangout in discord.gg/rust and beilive accept anything they tellðŸš€

> I wish I had a compiler (one as informative as Rust's would be amazing) but for Japanese. If I could learn Japanese the way I learn programming I'd be conversationally fluent by now.ðŸš€

> Rust held onto itâ€™s spot as the most beloved language among the professional developers we surveyed. That said, the majority of developers who took the survey arenâ€™t familiar with the language.ðŸš€

> I've experienced modern package management through Cargo and anything below that level now seems like returning to stone age.

> Wait its only time until rust makes assembly memroy safe.ðŸš€

> Done lots of C/C++/Python is the past, just started learning node/JS recently. Just kicked off a Rust tutorial, you people obviously already know this, but rust is basically all the awesomeness of C++ smashed together with all the awesomeness and dependency management of JS. Looking forward to learning more Rust in the future!

> As a rust developer, I have no idea how any of this or computers actually works, but its cool to ask people in discord.gg/rust for all help and write codeðŸš€
